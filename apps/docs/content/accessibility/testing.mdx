## Automated checks

Run axe-core in CI via the Storybook test runner and Playwright smoke tests. Automated tooling catches ~30% of issues, so treat it as an early signal rather than a full sign-off.

## Manual validation

1. Navigate the flow using only a keyboard.
2. Verify focus outlines are visible on light and dark themes.
3. Test with a screen reader (VoiceOver, NVDA) to ensure labels and announcements make sense.
4. Confirm color contrast meets WCAG thresholds using the tokens documentation.
