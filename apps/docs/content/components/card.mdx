## Overview

Cards provide a flexible container for summarizing entities such as projects, resources, or announcements. They can include imagery, supporting text, and action buttons. Keep the content hierarchy consistent: header, body, then footer.

When cards act as navigation triggers, mark the `interactive` flag and ensure the entire card is focusable. Include descriptive text that conveys the destination or action taken.

## UX Guidelines

- Maintain consistent padding and typography across card variants to reinforce familiarity.
- Align card actions horizontally and prefer primary buttons on the right for left-to-right locales.
- Use the subtle variant on surfaces that already provide elevation to avoid competing shadows.

## Accessibility details

Interactive cards must provide a clear focus state and respond to both click and keyboard activation (Enter/Space). When cards contain nested interactive elements, ensure that the card itself is not focusable to prevent focus traps. Use ARIA labelling if the card’s purpose is not apparent from visible text.
