## Palette

We derive product color from `@virtual-ds/tokens`. Brand blues appear as primary actions, while neutral surfaces provide structure for content.

```json
tokens.brand.primary = {
  "400": "#3B82F6",
  "500": "#2563EB",
  "600": "#1D4ED8"
}
```

Use semantic aliases for UI states instead of referencing raw brand values (for example `--state-success`). Maintain a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for text on backgrounds.

## Theming

Tokens ship with light and dark modes. Apply the correct theme by toggling the `data-theme` attribute on the document element. Custom themes can be layered by overriding semantic tokens while leaving component tokens intact.
